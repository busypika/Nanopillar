# Nanopillar
Simulate an nanopillar with Fortran and Matlab

## Requirements

Fortran 90/95
Matlab 2016 or higher version

## Instructions
To change parameters in the program, P_SIZE, SIZE and P_l are what youâ€™re looking for. SIZE stands for the FCC cubic size, keep it as much as you need while not taking too much computer performance. SIZE will effect to both P_SIZE and P_l, so choose wisely. P_SIZE determines the radius of pillar, the bigger it takes, a bigger hexagon shows up. P_l determines the length of nanopillar, this one should be smaller than SIZE to avoid errors.
